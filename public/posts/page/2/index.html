      This will be the first posting of a new category on my blog regard Kapow Software. Before I begin to discuss my usage experiences and technical information regarding Kapow Katalyst, I figure it would be good to give a little background about it. Kapow Katalyst is what known as a Web Data Aggregation Tool; these tools are used to capture data from websites for analytic&rsquo;s purposes. Where Kapow excels is it allows you to complete your ETL process from a single execution aka a Robot.

      Here’s another fun solution for you business intelligence people out there. Suppose you wanted to pull data that was updated in the last 15mins based on when a row was last. I&rsquo;m sure there are many ways to accomplish this but I like to use the DATEADD() function in Microsoft SQL Server 2008. Below is the query using the AdventureWorks2008R2 database enjoy.
SELECTI.ProductID,I.LocationID,I.Bin,I.Shelf,I.Quantity,P.ProductNumber,P.Name,I.ModifiedDateFROMAdventureWorks2008R2.Production.ProductInventoryASILEFTOUTERJOIN AdventureWorks2008R2.Production.ProductASPONI.ProductID=P.ProductIDWHERE(I.ModifiedDate&gt;=REPLACE(CONVERT(VARCHAR(19),DATEADD(minute,-30,GETDATE()),120),'-',&lsquo;/'))P.S. Before the query in the example will work on the AdventureWorks database you&rsquo;ll need to update a couple of rows on the ProductInventory table.

      Another #Meme 15 topic brought you by MVP Jason Strate (blog | twitter). This month topic &ldquo;What are ten blogs that you think other SQL Server professionals should be following but might not be?&quot; Coming up with a list of just 10 is harder than I thought narrowing it down to ten is just way to hard but i was able to do. The list I put together covers everyone from the newbie to SQL to the all-round DBA.

      A business partner approached me the other day looking to share information with my company. Since parts numbers are recycled more often than lame jokes in my business one of the things we needed the business partner to provide was the brand of the part. The business partner said that this would be difficult to do since they were unfamiliar with linking data across tables in any manner. After understanding a little about the setup of the partner&rsquo;s tables I taught them to design a view linking the two primary tables where the data could be seen together through a view.

I started blogging back in 2003 just about a one year after launching Gogorichie.com, back then it was the social network of its time along with AIM and YIM. As me and my high school friends went off to college we stayed in contact via our blogs.

      This month&rsquo;s T-SQL Tuesday topic is from Allen White. He posed the question of what is my favorite little SQL trick. I can&rsquo;t wait to see what tips the #SQLFamily write about. I discovered one of my favorite tricks last year, just a little background my first SQL version I started out administrating and developing on 8 years ago was SQL 2000 back then to get table statistics was no easy task.

        Meme Monday: What SQLFamily Means To Me

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I saw this topic a few weeks back on @sqlrockstar&rsquo;s site but never got around to writing a post.
I&rsquo;ve been in working on databases for about 6 years now a mixture of Access, SQL, Teradata, and MySQL. So when I saw the topic thoughts began to flow through my brain. What does the SQL Family mean to me?? it means that there is a network of people with the same interest, challenged by the same problems as me.

      As Jaycee members we have a long history of driving change in our communities across the country and all through our grassroots skills and efforts. For example, when a group of young business men in the Los Angeles area were dissatisfied with their representation in congress they sought out a candidate and came across a young who was a Jaycee their first reaction was here is a young man who has been through the best training in the world.

      Over the weekend I read another chapter of the book Young Men Can Change The World. I came across another great story this one of how the Abbeville Jaycees was founded. The story was a recount of the adventure of at the time U.S. Jaycees National Vice President Robert E. Condon who at the age of 29 also held the position of civil defense commissioner for the greater New York metro area.
