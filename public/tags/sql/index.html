      I&rsquo;ve been using Microsoft Access since Access 97 it&rsquo;s a very powerful tool is you use it right. You can use it for everything from personal Baseball card inventory control to managing home inventories; even fortune 500 companies use it to manage million dollar systems. As I said if you use it right it can be quite a powerful tool built on some amazing framework. Recently a friend who&rsquo;s getting into access asked me if I could provide him some resources so that he can get better familiar with the tool.

      Here’s another fun solution for you business intelligence people out there. Suppose you wanted to pull data that was updated in the last 15mins based on when a row was last. I&rsquo;m sure there are many ways to accomplish this but I like to use the DATEADD() function in Microsoft SQL Server 2008. Below is the query using the AdventureWorks2008R2 database enjoy.
SELECTI.ProductID,I.LocationID,I.Bin,I.Shelf,I.Quantity,P.ProductNumber,P.Name,I.ModifiedDateFROMAdventureWorks2008R2.Production.ProductInventoryASILEFTOUTERJOIN AdventureWorks2008R2.Production.ProductASPONI.ProductID=P.ProductIDWHERE(I.ModifiedDate&gt;=REPLACE(CONVERT(VARCHAR(19),DATEADD(minute,-30,GETDATE()),120),'-',&lsquo;/'))P.S. Before the query in the example will work on the AdventureWorks database you&rsquo;ll need to update a couple of rows on the ProductInventory table.

      A business partner approached me the other day looking to share information with my company. Since parts numbers are recycled more often than lame jokes in my business one of the things we needed the business partner to provide was the brand of the part. The business partner said that this would be difficult to do since they were unfamiliar with linking data across tables in any manner. After understanding a little about the setup of the partner&rsquo;s tables I taught them to design a view linking the two primary tables where the data could be seen together through a view.

      I saw this topic a few weeks back on @sqlrockstar&rsquo;s site but never got around to writing a post.
I&rsquo;ve been in working on databases for about 6 years now a mixture of Access, SQL, Teradata, and MySQL. So when I saw the topic thoughts began to flow through my brain. What does the SQL Family mean to me?? it means that there is a network of people with the same interest, challenged by the same problems as me.

      Last Friday I got a data request from a group asking for a report to be generated bi-hourly for customer request that were not responded to in a time span of two hours. So looking at the data I noticed that there were two columns that were time stamped one when the request was submitted and another when the request was completed, so this was easy I filtered out where the completed data was null and wrote a where statement using a Datediff syntax to breakdown the input date time stamp by hour and then subtracting two so my sql statement looks like the following example.
