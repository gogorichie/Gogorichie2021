      It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve written a #tsql2sday post, but thought that this month&rsquo;s topic was worthy of me hoping into the pool with the #sqlfamily. This month the subject is &ldquo;Automation&rdquo;. chosen by Hemanth D. (Blog | @SqlChow). If you want to read the opening post, please click the image above. I&rsquo;m lover of software automation and been a fan since writing my first macro in Excel when I was in high school.

      So I&rsquo;m about a month late or maybe three in writing my recap on the event so here goes. It was awesomeness !!!! 2012 marked my second SQL Saturday that I&rsquo;ve attended and have to say it just keeps getting better. This year I was able to volunteer with registration which is an awesome way to meet all the attendees well at least most of them. Also I hooped into five awesome sessions &ldquo;A Complete BI Solution in About an Hour!

      Another #Meme 15 topic brought you by MVP Jason Strate (blog | twitter). This month topic &ldquo;What are ten blogs that you think other SQL Server professionals should be following but might not be?&quot; Coming up with a list of just 10 is harder than I thought narrowing it down to ten is just way to hard but i was able to do. The list I put together covers everyone from the newbie to SQL to the all-round DBA.

      This month&rsquo;s Meme15 assignment and the first was chosen by Jason Strate (Blog|Twitter) he posed the assignment of writing about why do I blog and why I started.
I started blogging back in 2003 just about a one year after launching Gogorichie.com, back then it was the social network of its time along with AIM and YIM. As me and my high school friends went off to college we stayed in contact via our blogs.

        T-SQL Tuesday 025 - My Favorite Little Trick
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      This month&rsquo;s T-SQL Tuesday topic is from Allen White. He posed the question of what is my favorite little SQL trick. I can&rsquo;t wait to see what tips the #SQLFamily write about. I discovered one of my favorite tricks last year, just a little background my first SQL version I started out administrating and developing on 8 years ago was SQL 2000 back then to get table statistics was no easy task.

        Meme Monday: What SQLFamily Means To Me
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I saw this topic a few weeks back on @sqlrockstar&rsquo;s site but never got around to writing a post.
I&rsquo;ve been in working on databases for about 6 years now a mixture of Access, SQL, Teradata, and MySQL. So when I saw the topic thoughts began to flow through my brain. What does the SQL Family mean to me?? it means that there is a network of people with the same interest, challenged by the same problems as me.

      First off shout out to Thomas Larock for coming up with this idea. Today’s meme is “Write a SQL blog post in 11 words or less”, and here is my entry: Write query. Syntax error. Search Google. run query again. Happy dance!!!! Some more shout outs to my favorite readings from last month: * Pinal Dave (blog | @pinaldave) * Brent Ozar (blog | @BrentO) * Thomas Larock (blog | @sqlrockstar) * BIDN (blog | @bidn)

      I come from a different world in my company, I’m not IT though I have formal training, I speak the lingo, and wear the uniform of Jeans, t-shirt, glasses and ton’s of geekieness in my swagger. I’m what they call Business Intelligence or better known as Shadow IT. Though i&rsquo;m up front about what we do and the impact it has. In my company I’m the middle person between what the business thinks it wants and what it really needs long term.

      Earlier this month i attended my first SQL meetup called SQL Saturday #31 i&rsquo;m not sure why it&rsquo;s numbered 31 cause i realized they don&rsquo;t go in order. But yeah so it was hosted in Elk Grove so it wasn&rsquo;t to far away. I knew it was going to be a awesome day when i met this guy in the registration line who reads my site and learned a couple SQL tricks from it.
