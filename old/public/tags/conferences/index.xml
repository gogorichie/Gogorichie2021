      <description>This year I made the trip to San Francisco for Salesforce&amp;rsquo;s annual DreamForce a five day conference that trumps all other conference. Every aspect of the event was amazing and WOW 120,000 attendees. The leadership speaker series, the trainings, the networking opportunities, and the parties were all great. My highlights and most memorable moments were getting to meet a couple of vendors that I only get to speak with on the phone including one who is located in France.</description>
