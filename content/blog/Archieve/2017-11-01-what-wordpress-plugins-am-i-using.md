It’s been four years since I wrote my last update about what plugins I’m using on my WordPress platform. I’ve gotten more simple about the plugins and what I need them to do for me. Last time I wrote a post about the plugins their were seven and now I’m only running five.

<div>| Akismet Anti-Spam | By Automattic | This plugin helps you block and filter out spammer comments. According to them Akismet blocks 99.9% of spam from reaching your blog. I think they do a great job and I love it and I’ve been using it since 2010. |
|---|---|---|
| GoDaddy Pro Sites Worker | By GoDaddy | I manage quite a few Jaycee WordPress sites and this plugin is amazing it lets me manage the backups and updates on the backend all from one screen. It’s like OMS for WordPress on Godaddy . |
| iThemes Security | By iThemes | This Plugin helps you lock down WordPress platform and is easy-to-use. |
| Jetpack by WordPress.com | By Automattic | I mentioned this one last time. |
| Redirection |  | Helps you manage all your 301 redirects and monitor 404 errors |
