![](http://docs.google.com/File?id=df7fzjds_13d2mj9vcr_b)What are you doing? that’s a question that you are probably asked dozens of time a day. How many of you use the Facebook status function each day? How many of you use it more than once each day? Well, this year the North Region Jaycees are trying something new and we will be using a free service named Twitter to communicate all kinds of one line answers, event postings, random thoughts, and newsflashes about articles recently added to the Region’s website [<u>www.northregionjaycees.com</u>](http://www.northregionjaycees.com/). How can you and your chapter use Twitter? Twitter has many uses such as sending out help requests to all your members while you are already on site project day via a single text message from your cell phone. It could also be used for sending updates to your chapter website and my favorite- keeping members up-to-date with upcoming events. Once they read how much fun you are having, they may want to attend the next time-especially state and national conventions. Twitter’s popularity has exploded over the last year thanks in part to the 2008 Presidential race. Both parties used Twitter to communicate with hundreds of thousands of supporters. Last year, Dell showed that Twitter can be used as a source of income when they generated over a million dollars in sales from the service by posting items for sale.
