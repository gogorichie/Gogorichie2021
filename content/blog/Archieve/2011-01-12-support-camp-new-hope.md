Each year members of the Illinois Jaycees support Camp New Hope through various community drives and as part of our annual fund raising campaign. Camp New Hope Respite building started construction 10 years ago, but due to the loss of State and Federal funding and the despair of our current economy, the construction remains unfinished. This building is used for the year round respite program which gives reprive to those families with members with special needs. Vote to give this idea 25K: Finish Camp New Hope Respite Building for the developmentally disabled <http://pep.si/fZ5MDa> and you can learn more about and support them through their website at [http://www.myfavoritecamp.org](http://www.myfavoritecamp.org/)
