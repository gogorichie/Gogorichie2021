It's been a while since I've written a #[tsql2sday](https://twitter.com/search?q=tsql2sday&src=typd) post, but thought that this month's topic was worthy of me hoping into the pool with the #sqlfamily. This month the subject is "Automation". chosen by Hemanth D. ([Blog](http://sqlchow.wordpress.com/) | [@SqlChow](https://twitter.com/SqlChow)). If you want to read the opening post, please click the image above. I'm lover of software automation and been a fan since writing my first macro in Excel when I was in high school. I loved anything that makes it easier for you to get more done with less. Back in the 2000's I got introduced to SQL 2000 and DTS and it changed my world. My first package I created was awesome and so exciting it took data from database and put it into another one and then truncated the table, once I scheduled it to run I was able to not worry about handling that task anymore and sleep peacefully. Since then I've found my passion and made a living improving businesses through process improvement using automation.
