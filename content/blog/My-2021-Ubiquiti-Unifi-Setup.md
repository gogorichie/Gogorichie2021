This is a continuation from my 2020 network overhaul. You can read the details about how this project started [here](/blog/my-2020-ubiquiti-unifi-setup/).

**Recap**
I ended the updates to my home network in 2020 in a good place and by that I mean everything was running smooth with full network management. There were no issues but lot's of opportunies for improvement.

1. Replacing my Nest cameras and doorbell
2. Replace my USG-Pro-4 with a UDM-Pro and move the non-POE devices to that device's built-in 8 port switch.
3. Replace the 8 port POE switch and the 5 port USW Flex Mini with a 16 or 24 port POE switch.

**Iteration Four**

2021 Improvement to my home network was focused on two areas preparing for Wifi 6 and reduce dependancies on 3rd party cloud services.
My first Unifi network last 6 months it was simply a unifi 8 port switch, AC-Pro, and an AC-Lite. The controller running off a raspberry pi 3b. Pretty simple and just a tad bit under 200 bucks to get it up and running. The wife was happy, I was happy with the network performance, but the data nerd and DIYer within me itching for more now that I saw what software-defined networking could do.
