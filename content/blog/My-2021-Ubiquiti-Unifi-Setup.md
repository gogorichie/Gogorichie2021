This is a continuation from my 2020 network overhaul. You can read the details about how this project started [here](/blog/my-2020-ubiquiti-unifi-setup/).

**Recap**
I ended the updates to my home network in 2020 in a good place and by that I mean everything was running smooth with the full network being management. There were no issues but lot's of opportunies for improvement.

1. Replacing my Nest cameras and doorbell
2. Replace my USG-Pro-4 with a UDM-Pro and move the non-POE devices to that device's built-in 8 port switch.
3. Replace the 8 port switch and 5 port USW Flex Mini in my great room  with a 16 or 24 port POE switch.

**Iteration Four**

2021 Improvement to my home network was focused on two areas preparing for Wifi 6 and reduce dependancies on 3rd party cloud services.
