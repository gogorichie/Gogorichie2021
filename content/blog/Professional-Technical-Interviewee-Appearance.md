A few months back had the opportunity to joined my friend Taylor Dorsett on his Podcast to talk about Professional Technical Interviews from a DevOps perspective. If you're interested in the DevOps space this is a great conversation to listen. Be sure to check it out over on his Youtube channel [Professional Technical Interviewee with Taylor Dorsett](https://youtu.be/t7QUvYqGS8s).
