In July 2019 I officially stop using the WordPress CMS. It took me many years to realize all the things I loved about WordPress were also the same things but ultimately led me to leave the platform. I really loved the ability to customize The platform to my needs using any plugin I could possibly dream of or better find online and there are many options out there. I really loved the ability to post my intent that I saw fit and I mean over the years I’ve posted almost 3000 blog posts.
 
Trust me a lot of it was garbage my WordPress blog began its life as my livejournal.com blog and then it was migrated over to blogspot.com and Eventually found its way to being self-hosted on GoDaddy as my WordPress site in 2011. With WordPress you get the freedom to shape the content, design, and features as you see fit but with that comes the overhead of having to maintain databases, plug-ins, and cms software itself. Because if you fail to do that someone is bound to hijack your site and possibly use your site to spread malicious content that could harm others. Managing a WordPress site can be a full-time job and that’s without writing a blog post. Sure there are products out there that make the administration process easier but for the average blogger who just wants to share their knowledge or content with the world, this could be a huge burden. It eventually got to the post of where i was patching and updating plugins, wordpress, and the backend mysql server more than creating content.

I really missed the days of HTML it was so simple to maintain. So i archived the site, and launched a landing page in it's place using a html5up template [you cand find the code here on Github](https://github.com/gogorichie/html/).
