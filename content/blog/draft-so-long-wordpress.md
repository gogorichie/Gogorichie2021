I took down my WordPress site in early 2019 and launched a static html5 landing site to hold its place while I figured out how not to spend time maintaining a WordPress site anymore. I ended up settling on Hugo.

**WordPress Love & Hate**

It took me many years to realize, that all the things I loved about WordPress were also the same things that led me to leave the platform.  I loved the ability to customize the platform to my needs using any plugin I could dream of or better find online and there are many options out there. I really loved the ability to post my intent that I saw fit and I mean over the years I’ve posted almost 3000 blog posts. Trust me a lot of it was garbage my WordPress blog began its life as my livejournal.com blog and then it was migrated over to blogspot.com and Eventually found its way to being self-hosted on GoDaddy as my WordPress site in 2011. With WordPress you get the freedom to shape the content, design, and features as you see fit but with that comes the overhead of having to maintain databases, plug-ins, and CMS software itself. Because if you fail to do that someone is bound to hijack your site and possibly use your site to spread malicious content that could harm others.

Managing a WordPress site can be a full-time job and that’s without writing a blog post. Sure there are products out there that make the administration process easier but for the average blogger who just wants to share their knowledge or content with the world, this could be a huge burden. It eventually got to the point where I was patching and updating plugins, WordPress, and the backend MySQL server more than creating content. The last three years have been filled with major attacks on self-hosted WordPress sites.
