Part my role at Coyote involves me work with community orginzations. In early 2019 Coyote's Software Development group became involved with [Code Nation](https://codenation.org/), an 501c3 organization based out of New York, which is focused on equipping students, in under-resourced high schools, with the skills, experiences, and connections that give them access to careers in technology.

Code Nationâ€™s approach is using a volunteer teaching corp of hundreds of professional web and software
developers, that provide tuition-free coding courses and work-based learning programs to students of
these under-resourced schools. [Code Nation](https://codenation.org/) focuses on Latinx and Black students, 45% of these students being female.

The program is divided into 3 phases. Phase 1 exposes 10 grade students to coding and how to create
code, in phase 2 11th and 12 grade students gain assistance in career preparation, and in phase 3 the
students benefit from continued mentorship post-graduation.

The program runs the entire school year kicking off in September and wrapping up in June. In Chicago 6
high schools were selected to be part of this program: Dyett HS, Johnson College Prep, Michele Clark
HS, Rauner College Prep, and UIC College Prep. Combined these 6 high schools are preparing more than
100 students for careers in technology.

The volunteer instructors/mentors are provided with ready-to deliver curriculum and coaching from the Code Nation staff. Four volunteer instructors/mentors are placed at each school site to team-teach the class.

Students meet with the volunteer instructors/mentors twice a week, either in the morning or afternoon, for a class session lasting 60-90 minutes. Outside of the classroom the student participates in hack-a-thons, coding challenges and takes field trips to tech companies in the surrounding area.

More information about Code Nation Chicago can be found [on their website](https://codenation.org/).
