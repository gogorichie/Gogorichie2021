When the Hoffman Estates Jaycees needed a update to their aging website. I worked with the chapter executive board to bring a fresh new look to their website. For this site it required moving over all the current chapter contain as well as introducing some new features. I choose [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) as the platform to host their site because two of their board members were familiar with it and training the rest of the board wouldnâ€™t be a problem. The Hoffman Estates Jaycees is a leadership development and networking group for adults between the age of 18 and 40 in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. Check out the groups website at <http://www.hoffmanestatesjaycees.org>
