One of the challenges I face within Salesforce is noticing performance issues before my users do. It doesn’t happen to often but when it does my users notice. Like any other system Salesforce is only as weak as its weakest link. To help me stay ahead without constantly having to look at [trust.salesforce.com](https://trust.salesforce.com) I’ve created a zap using [Zapier](http://zpr.io/gamt) to monitor the rss feed for my server and send me a email when an incident is reported though the rss feed. Check out my zap below.
