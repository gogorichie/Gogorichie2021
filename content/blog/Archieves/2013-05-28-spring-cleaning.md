![](http://www.gogorichie.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/052813_2029_SpringClean1.png)It’s a couple of months since my last post and even longer since I’ve logged into the backend of my site. So this morning I did a lot admining of my site, kicked the morning off by removing a bunch of old plugins, old backups, and decided to take the twenty twelve theme for a test drive. While I’m at it’s been two years since my original posting on which [wordpress plugin I use](http://www.gogorichie.com/2011/01/my-top-ten-wordpress-plugins/). Well since then a lot of my favorite plugins have been consolidated or are now obsolete with the improvements to the wordpress platform. From that list of 10 I put out two years ago I’m still running 7 of them [kPicasa Gallery](http://wordpress.org/plugins/kpicasa-gallery/), [Google Analytics for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-analytics-for-wordpress/), [XBOX Live Gamertag](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/xbox-gamertag-widget/), [Akismet](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/akismet/), [Redirection](http://urbangiraffe.com/plugins/redirection/), and [Most Popular Posts](http://www.wesg.ca/2008/08/wordpress-widget-most-popular/). But the latest ones I can’t live without are [Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/), [KB Advanced RSS Widget](http://wordpress.org/plugins/kb-advanced-rss-widget/), and [BackUpWordPress](http://wordpress.org/plugins/backupwordpress/).
