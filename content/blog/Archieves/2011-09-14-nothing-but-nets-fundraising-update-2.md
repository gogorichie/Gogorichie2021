![](http://iljaycees.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/nets.jpg)What an awesome GA we had this past weekend!!! Saturday during Lunch Anthony Colletti spoke about how close we are the our 2011 Nothing But Nets goal and our chapters STEPPED UP big time…to the tune of $1051.00 in pledges and donations. A big thanks goes out to all those chapters Mount Prospect, Gurnee/Lindenhurst, Bolingbrook, Chatham, Woodstock, Lombard, and Woodridge. Once we receive all the checks we will be only $289 away from our goal !!! please consider making a donation of 10 bucks to our [State Nothing But Nets Site](http://bit.ly/thedrivefor289).
