That made really think about cancer and we can cure it. Cancer is one of those diseases that effects people no matter if their rich or poor . If their Black or white, we all know someone who has been impacted by cancer. For the past three years I’ve gotten involved with Relays all across the northwest suburbs. As you may [![Me & Ann with the MP JC's](https://www.gogorichie.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/s73009281-thumb.jpg "Me & Ann with the MP JC's")](https://www.gogorichie.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/s73009281.jpg)know I’m a member of the [Jaycees](http://www.usjaycees.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=78&Itemid=204) and they are heavy supporters of the American Cancer Society, especially the Relay For Life program. Please consider making a donation to the American Cancer Society to keep the fight going for those we’ve lost in the battle of cancer.
