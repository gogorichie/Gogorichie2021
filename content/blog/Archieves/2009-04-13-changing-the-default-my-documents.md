When I’m in the office I use my desktop PC and then at home I use my work laptop, prior to last year accessing my work files on my Desktop from work was nearly impossible. An then everyone got their own personal network share about year. Since then I’ve been saving all my files to my share and accessing them their over our corp. vpn to get to them. Well [![image](http://www.gogorichie.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/windowslivewriter88b32ebe8110-d7e3image-thumb-1.png)](http://www.gogorichie.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/windowslivewriter88b32ebe8110-d7e3image-4.png) each time when I start a new file I had to change my saving location from my documents to my network folder and well, that gets kind of old so I figure why not take it one step further. Why don’t I just change my default my documents location. Well after downing a little search on the Internet I came a article in the MSDN Here’s a link to it if you want to change your default my documents location too <http://tinyurl.com/9ngo7y>
