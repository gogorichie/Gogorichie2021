Last week i got the new [Blackberry 8520 Curve](http://na.blackberry.com/eng/devices/blackberrycurve8500/) and i though I would write my first five things similar to ones did on the [blackberry blog site](http://blogs.blackberry.com/2009/07/the-first-5-things---andrey.html). Since i this my third blackberry I’ve got my steps setting up down pretty good.

1. Download [Google Mobile Apps](http://www.google.com/mobile/); OMG this has got to be my used applications on my blackberry. First the Google sync is one hell of an application it syncs up my address book and calendar to my Gmail account. Then instead of using the blackberry maps application i would rather use Google maps. Google
2. Download [Facebook](http://na.blackberry.com/eng/devices/features/social/facebook.jsp) and setup app so that it downloads pictures to my contacts, calendar events, and what not’s
3. Pull down a new service book; so that my work, Jaycees, and personal emails start flowing to my new device.
4. Ping all my friends with my new pin; Blackberry messenger has to be one of most easy to use messenger clients out there, btw if you want my PIN text me and I’ll give it to you.
5. Set my background; of course i use one the White Sox. I pulled one that i took last year while me and Ann was at the sox game down from my Facebook mobile pictures album.

This new Blackberry device has way more capabilities then my last model. First I’m taking full advantage of the [Apps World](http://na.blackberry.com/eng/services/appworld/?iid=AppWorld_Homepage) and second OMG [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com/blackberry) runs so smooth and fast on it just like playing a song from my iTunes Library.
