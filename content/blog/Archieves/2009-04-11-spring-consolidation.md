It couldn’t be more picture perfect. I’m just relaxing at home outside with a miller lite and my laptop. I figure today was a great day to spend a little time cleaning up my network. My home is scanning for duplicate files[![image](https://www.gogorichie.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/image-thumb1.png "image")](https://www.gogorichie.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/image1.png) across my network and when it’s done it will be time to dump some of those too. I figure now is a good time while I wait why don’t I import some more postings from back in the day when I use to have a livejournal account. Today I’m introducing just about 200 new posting from 2005 and 2006 and few from early 2008 that were posted to my old livejournal blog “[The Wondering Mind Of GoGoRichie](http://gogorichie.livejournal.com)” I hope you enjoy them there quiet funny especial the ones written after coming home from the bar such as “[How to block the mother hen attack](https://www.gogorichie.com/?p=599)” I know it’s one Jessica’s favorites.
