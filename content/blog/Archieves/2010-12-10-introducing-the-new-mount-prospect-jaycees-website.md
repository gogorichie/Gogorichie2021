When the Mount Prospect Jaycees needed a update to their aging website which i first built back in [2008](https://www.gogorichie.com/2008/11/mount-prospect-jaycees-site-comments/). I worked with the chapter executive board to bring a fresh new look to their website. For this site it required moving over all the current chapter contain as well as introducing some new features. I choose [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) as the platform to host their site because two of their board members were familiar with it and training the rest of the board wouldnâ€™t be a problem. Also sent just about two hour training the sites webmaster and off she was running making updates and changes on her own. The Mount Prospect Jaycees is a leadership development and networking group for adults between the age of 18 and 40 in Mount Prospect, Illinois.
