Last friday was exciting I announced my candidacy for 2012 Area One Vice President of the Illinois Jaycees. I believe that we can grow our area with outstanding Training held locally, We can use the Knowledge of our members and our networks to strengthen our area, and We can retain our members through all the Opportunities our organization have to offer. Like my page on Facebook at <http://www.facebook.com/Voteforrichard> and follow my campaign. Since our organizations election is less then two weeks away I’m visiting 14 chapters in 13 days with a three day vacation in the middle of my campaign. I want to get out and hear from our members what are their concerns across the Area chapters in the Fox Valley may have different concerns then chapters in the Northeast or Northwest.
