What can you do with 10 dollars? Hmmm buy a shirt, buy 2 footlong subs at subway, buy a couple gallons of gas, 2 cups of Grande coffee at starbucks, or save a life. Yup it’s true for just 10 dollars you can save a life. Malaria infects nearly 500 million![](https://www.gogorichie.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/012411_1714_MakingOurIm1.png) people each year and kills more than one million of those who become infected. Last year State Chairwomen Sue Warmuskerken introduced us to the JCI Nothing But Nets program and with yours along with all the members of JCI efforts we have made an impact on this disease. It use to be every 30 seconds a kid was dying from Malaria. Since our participation in JCI Nothing but Nets, it is down to a kid dying every 45 seconds. Now that’s a impact, but I think we can increase that impact this year. Now if you’re not familiar with this program let give you a quick overview. The program is run by the UN and JCI our international organization is a partner in helping the fight. But of course their not along tons of major sports teams, fortune 500 companies and other non for profit groups are helping too. The way it works is for every 10 dollars donated a bed net is manufactured and given to person in need within Africa. Malaria carrying mosquitoes generally bite between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. A bed net is typically hung above the center of a bed or sleeping space so that it completely covers the sleeping person. One bed net can safely last a family for about three years, thanks to a long-lasting insecticide woven into the net fabric. This year our goal is to STEP UP double the funds raised across the state in 2010 and to provide 300 nets.
