When I interviewed with [Coyote](http://www.coyote.com) a discussion came up of passion and I said my passion at work was turning data into insight for my coworkers. During my presentation about myself to our Executive team and my coworkers I realized what my true passion is… it’s to help people. Every job I’ve had involved helping people and at [Coyote](http://www.coyote.com) it’s no different I’m just using my technical skills to help our coworkers and our customers; outside work I love to volunteer with the [Jaycees](http://www.usjaycees.org) because we help people and make an impact with the work we do around the world. In our organization’s creed we’ve got this line that can sum it all up for me *“Service to Humanity Is the Best Work of Life”* so let me ask you what is your passion?
