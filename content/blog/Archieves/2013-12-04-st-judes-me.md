Each I give my time and money to many causes. The way I handle giving my time and money to causes is simple. Through the Jaycees I’m able to give my time to many causes in the way of service to my local community and of course my favorite is Hospital Care-a-van which was run by the Mount Prospect Jaycees. Now as for money, each year I pick a different organization I’m interested in and give my money to them and I ask my friends to join in and support me in making an impact in that organizations cause. Last year I picked the United Nations Nothing But Nets organization which help prevents Malaria by providing bed nets around the world. This year I’ve chosen St. Judes Children’s Hospital. St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is internationally recognized for its pioneering research and treatment of children with cancer and other catastrophic diseases. St. Jude is the first and only pediatric cancer center to be designated as a Comprehensive Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute and we all know cancer sucks. St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital is internationally recognized for its pioneering research and treatment of children with cancer and other catastrophic diseases.
