It’s me !!!!!it was just recently announced that I’ll be taking the US Jaycees website from the current webmaster David. No real reason why was giving why the change. But they posted they were looking on the site and I responded with a letter to President Jeff and the Exec board. Look for more postings over the 12 months about my adventures as their 2010 Website Program Manager.
