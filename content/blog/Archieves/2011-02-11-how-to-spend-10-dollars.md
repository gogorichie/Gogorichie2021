Last month in my Illinois Jaycees newsletter article I talked about what you could do with 10 dollars and the Nothing But Nets Program. How cool is this, today I came across a you tube video asking the same question. The point of the matter is for 10 dollars you can save a person from malaria. Get involved in the Nothing But Nets campaign it can prevent the spread of a disease.

If you havenâ€™t done so already donate 10 dollars to save a life from malaria <http://www.crowdrise.com/jciusanbn/fundraiser/gogorichie>
