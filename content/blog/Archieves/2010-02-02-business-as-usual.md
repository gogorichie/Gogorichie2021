Today I’ll begin working the US Jaycees Site. My first task is to perform a Full DB backup just incase something goes wrong. This was going well until I ran into my first problem i was unable to access the db server which is no big deal since i could get into the php admin panel. It’s been so long since I’ve had to perform a manual backup in MYSQL. But that what they make Google for right? After getting the backup completed and burned to a CD i moved on to updated the directory and posting some new documents. While doing this I came up with a interesting idea to keep track of my work though out the year. I’m using Google docs and created a form using the form feature to track my work which is pictured below. I really haven’t put much though into changing the site design and layout. I personally like it so lets see what people ask me to do.
