2022 was an amazing you year for me to get back to what i love doing, presenting and learning from great practioners. To wrap up my 2022 travels for the year i had the opportunity to present at [DevOps Days Tampa](https://devopsdays.org/events/2022-tampa/welcome/). 




Attending DevOps Days Chicago, in 2022 was a different experience as it was my first time speaking and presenting in Chicago my home city! and thought it was an ignite talk it was still exciting nonetheless. While I'm thinking about it this year seems to have been the year of me talking about how to deal with outages while remaining common and building the psychological confidence within your team to do the same. Trying to frame this into a night talk was a completely different experience. Getting the slides down to 20 and then delivering points within five seconds per slide it’s quite a unique challenge but it can’t be done.

One of the things I really like about the conference is continuous feedback opportunities. It begins with the code of conduct reviewed at the beginning of  each day, it’s offered through the break out spaces offered, and through the survey collected each day to the attendees.

**Key takeaways from this year’s conference:**

- IaC was the talk all over the place it’s no surprise. The number of people presenting about it and open spaces featuring this topic dominated and we’re quite full. Also while I’m thinking of it very few people knew of or didn't care about using the Amazon CDK or Azure Bicep for automation.
- The distinguishment between SRE, platform engineer, and Dev ops engineer roles are still kind of blurry. I expect the next few years to shape this up.
- Security in the software supply chain is fresh to most of the attendees. One security vendor described it as the Wild West.
- Tool sprawl isn’t as important to people as how to document their existence, and where to find documentation internally.
- I get to catch so many of the talks on YouTube or while traveling to these conferences but the one I thought was the most interesting was Learning from your organization's latest incident: How We Got Here it was presented by [Vanessa from Jeli](https://devopsdays.org/events/2022-chicago/program/vanessa-huerta-granda/).
