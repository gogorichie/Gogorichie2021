Earlier this month i attended my first SQL meetup called [SQL Saturday #31](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/31/eventhome.aspx) i'm not sure why it's numbered  31 cause i realized they don't go in order. But yeah so it was hosted in Elk Grove so it wasn't to far away. I knew it was going to be a awesome day when i met this guy in the registration line who reads my site and learned a couple SQL tricks from it. How sweet is that right? So SQL Saturday is put on by the Professional Association for SQL Server and ran by volunteers.

It's a combination of SQL Trainings, Forums, and networking events crammed into a 8 hour day. Plus I won an Xbox 360 Elite from Microsoft wooo and a copy of sql server 2008 admin pocket guide. Below are the cool sessions  i attended but just there only ones. It was just the ones i was interested in. I look forward to getting out to more of the meetups this year.

1.  Building a Data Warehouse using SQL Server 2008
2.  PowerShell for Data Professionals
3.  Oh Cluster, My Cluster!
4.  How and When to Use Indexed Views
