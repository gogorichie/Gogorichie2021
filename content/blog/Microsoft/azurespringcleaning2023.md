**Overview**

Welcome to day one of [Azure Spring Cleaning 2023!](https://www.azurespringclean.com/). Azure Static Web Apps have been generally available for about one and a half years now, and I've been excited about this service since day one. Professionally, I help customers reduce software delivery complexity, so for me, Static Web Apps are an amazing idea that reduces the time needed to get services up and running.

Azure Static Web Apps gives you a bundle of features but here are two I love.

1. Support for modern and web 3.0 services such as JavaScript frameworks and libraries like Angular, React, Svelte, Vue, or Blazor. Support for web applications with frameworks like Next.js and not to mention support for static site frameworks like Gatsby, Hugo, VuePress.

2. Built into the service is support for authentication provider integrations with Azure Active Directory, GitHub, and Twitter. Also free SSL certificates, which are automatically renewed.

I feel privileged to share my knowledge with you, and I hope that my contribution will be helpful to you and that you will learn a lot this week.
