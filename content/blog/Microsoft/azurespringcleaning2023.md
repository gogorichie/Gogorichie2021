**Overview**
Welcome to day one of [Azure Spring Cleaning 2023](https://www.azurespringclean.com/). Azure Static Web Apps has been GA for about 1 and half now and I've been excited for this service since day one. Professionally I help customers reduce the software delivery complexity. So for me Static Web Apps is an amazing idea that reduce the time needed to get services up and running.

Azure Static Web Apps gives you a bundle of features here's a few highlights.

Support for modern and web 3.0 services such as JavaScript frameworks and libraries like Angular, React, Svelte, Vue, or Blazor. Support for web applications with frameworks like Next.js and not to mention support for static site frameworks like Gatsby, Hugo, VuePress.

Built into the service is support for authentication provider integrations with Azure Active Directory, GitHub, and Twitter. Also free SSL certificates, which are automatically renewed.
