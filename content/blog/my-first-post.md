My first post using Hugo so this is the HelloWorld moment!

I’ve been a developer for over 20 years… it’s hard to say and even harder for me to believe. Not only am I getting old but when you launch your first website when your 15 that 20-year mark creeps up mighty quickly.

I think I’m going to like it here. But in the meantime, you can find me at gogorichie.com been there since 2002
