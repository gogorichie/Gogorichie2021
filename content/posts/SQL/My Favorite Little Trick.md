This month's T-SQL Tuesday topic is from [Allen White](http://sqlblog.com/blogs/allen_white/default.aspx). He posed the question of what is my favorite little SQL trick. I can't wait to see what tips the [#SQLFamily](https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23sqlfamily) write about. I discovered one of my favorite tricks last year, just a little background my first SQL version I started out administrating and developing on 8 years ago was SQL 2000 back then to get table statistics was no easy task. These days you just need to right-click on the database and go the reports to get much of the information you'll need about a database. I started using SQL 2008 last year so when I when wrote a [blog post](http://www.gogorichie.com/2010/05/determing-sql-server-table-size-tip/) about this little trick I came across online on how to quickly pull the table size information it had been one of my favorite tricks then. Since I'm still dealing with data in SQL 2000 server production environment still this trick still comes in handy. Thanks to the posting by [Mitchel Sellers](http://www.mitchelsellers.com/) on [How to Determine Table Size](http://www.mitchelsellers.com/blogs/articletype/articleview/articleid/121/determing-sql-server-table-size.aspx) it's become quick and easy to get the information I need about my databases.
