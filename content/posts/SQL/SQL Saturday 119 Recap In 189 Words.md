![](http://www.gogorichie.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/070712_0227_SQLSaturday1.png)So I'm about a month late or maybe threeÂ in writing my recap on the event so here goes. It was awesomeness !!!! 2012 marked my second SQL Saturday that I've attended and have to say it just keeps getting better. This year I was able to volunteer with registration which is an awesome way to meet all the attendees well at least most of them. Also I hooped into five awesome sessions "A Complete BI Solution in About an Hour!" With [Arron King](http://www.aaronstanleyking.com/), SRS Report Builder for Business Intelligence with David Eichner, Kama Sutra of SSIS: A guide to loving ETL with [Bill Fellows](http://billfellows.blogspot.com/), and The Script Task, powerhouse of SSIS with [Norman Kelm](http://www.gerasus.com/), and Join Us! Getting Started as a Technical Speaker with [Eddie Wuerch](http://indydba.com/) cause I would love to start speaking at SQL events outside of work. Biggest take a way's from this year event was networking with others in the profession and the knowledge I picked up from all the sessions. I'm already looking forward to the 2013 event.
