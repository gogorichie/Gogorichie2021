I saw this topic a few weeks back on [@sqlrockstar](http://thomaslarock.com/2011/11/meme-monday-for-november/)'s site but never got around to writing a post.

I've been in working on databases for about 6 years now a mixture of Access, SQL, Teradata, and MySQL. So when I saw the topic thoughts began to flow through my brain. What does the SQL Family mean to me?? it means that there is a network of people with the same interest, challenged by the same problems as me. Now with my discovery of twitter, hence the hashtag Iâ€™ve been able to discovered the family and discovered local events such as the user groups in Chicago and SQL Saturday's events and many others including a yearly [cruise](http://sqlcruise.com/). Now when i need help with programming question I can turn to the [#sqlfamily](https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23sqlfamily), the people are so cool that when its someone's birthday or other special occasion they get acknowledged by the [#sqlfamily](https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23sqlfamily) or even a sad event the family member off words of comfort.
