I've been using Microsoft Access since Access 97 it's a very powerful tool is you use it right. You can use it for everything from personal Baseball card inventory control to managing home inventories; even fortune 500 companies use it to manage million dollar systems. As I said if you use it right it can be quite a powerful tool built on some amazing framework. Recently a friend who's getting into access asked me if I could provide him some resources so that he can get better familiar with the tool. Below is a list of resources I put together for him.
